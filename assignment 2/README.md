## Task 1: Check Even or Odd

**Description**:  
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether it is an even or odd number.

### ðŸ”¢ How it Works:
1. Takes input from the user.
2. Converts the input into an integer.
3. Uses the modulo operator `%` to check if the number is divisible by 2.
4. Prints whether the number is **even** or **odd**.

### ðŸ“Œ Example:
Enter a number: 8
8 is an even number

## Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

**Description**:  
This program calculates the sum of all integers from **1 to 50** using a `for` loop.

### ðŸ”¢ How it Works:
1. Initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Loops through numbers from 0 to 50 using `range(0, 51)`.
3. Adds each number to the `sum` variable.
4. Prints the final sum.

### ðŸ“Œ Output:
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
