# 📘 Assignment 3 - Python Programs

This assignment includes two Python tasks focusing on **loops**, **recursion**, and the use of Python’s built-in **math module**.

## 🧮 Task 1: Factorial Using Loop and Recursion

### 🔹 Description

This task demonstrates two methods to calculate the factorial of a number:

1. **Using a for loop (iterative method)**
2. **Using recursion (function calls itself)**

### ✅ How It Works

- The user inputs a number `num`.
- The factorial is first calculated using a loop.
- Then, a recursive function `fact()` is defined and used to calculate the same factorial.

### 🧪 Example

Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120
Factorial of 5 is 120



> Note: The second output is from the recursive function.

## 📐 Task 2: Math Operations Using `math` Module

### 🔹 Description

This task uses Python’s `math` module to calculate three operations on a user-given number:

- **Square root**
- **Natural logarithm** (base e)
- **Sine** (angle in radians)

### ✅ How It Works

- The program takes a number as input.
- Uses:
  - `math.sqrt()` for square root
  - `math.log()` for logarithm
  - `math.sin()` for sine
- Results are printed in a readable format.

### 🧪 Example


Enter a number: 10
Square root : 3.1622776601683795
logarithm : 2.302585092994046
sin : -0.5440211108893698
